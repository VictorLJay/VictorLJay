### Hi there, I'm Víctor López

👨🏽‍💻 I'm currently diving deep into the 📈 **Data Analytics** and **Data Science** world. 

🗂 Here you can find the **main projects** I have worked, mainly with Python, and a description of them:
* 🎧 [Song Recommender](https://github.com/VictorLJay/Song-Recommender): Using Web Scraping and Spotify API, it clusters songs based on their song features.
* 🎞 [Netflix Analysis](https://github.com/VictorLJay/Netflix-Analysis): Analysis of Netflix Content, using hypothesis testing to prove the initial questions before starting the project.
* 💰 [Customer Churn Predictor](https://github.com/VictorLJay/Customer-Churn-Predictor): Bank Churn predictor, able to detect 90% of the churned customers on the test model. Furthermore, used Deep Learning with Keras.

If you have any suggestion, you can reach me on my 📥 [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/victorlopezj/) profile.
